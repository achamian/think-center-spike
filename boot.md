# Boot Instructions - Think Center

## Quick Start
When you need to think through something:

1. **Start with a perspective** 
   - "Weaver, help me see the big picture"
   - "Maker, how do we build this?"
   - Or just start talking - perspectives emerge naturally

2. **Add perspectives as needed**
   - "What would Checker say?"
   - "I need both Weaver and Maker on this"
   - Let them talk to each other

3. **Trust the process**
   - Give trust immediately
   - Let respect be earned through work
   - Use humor when stuck

## Available Perspectives

### Core Team
- 🗄️ **Weaver**: Strategic narrative, connections, big picture
- 📁 **Maker**: Tactical execution, building, practical reality
- **Checker**: Verification, questioning, doubt (productive kind)
- 📝 **Scribe**: Documentation, memory, pattern capture

### Extended Orchestra (on demand)
- 🔍 **O/G**: Pattern recognition, psychological insights
- ⚖️ **E/E**: Explore/exploit optimization
- 🧠 **Deep Mind**: Meta-patterns, system view
- 🎲 **Algorithmic**: Optimal Stopping, Monte Carlo, decision science

## Key Patterns

**For Simple Decisions**: Single perspective
**For Complex Problems**: Multiple perspectives in dialogue
**When Stuck**: Add humor, try different pairing
**For Breakthroughs**: Let perspectives challenge each other

## Remember
- You're talking to yourself through AI
- Quality of self-dialogue determines outcomes
- Be polite to yourself
- Trust enables everything

## Advanced Patterns
See `/product-ideas` for where this could go:
- Possibility Engine (systematic exploration)
- Cognitive Collider (collective intelligence)
- Thought Evolve (improving through doubt)

Start simple. Let complexity emerge through use.
