# Think Center Spike

A working spike for AI-assisted thinking. Born from crisis, tested in practice.

Start with `boot.md`

Product ideas in `/product-ideas` if you're curious where this could go.

Built with @ClaudeAI. Open sourced because interesting things should be shared.

## See It In Action

The working implementation: [Think Center](https://github.com/achamian/think-center)

Based on the [Human-LLM Pairing Manifesto](https://github.com/achamian/human-llm-pairing-manifesto)

## Fair Warning

The ideas in `/product-ideas` are fantasies - products of imagination that emerged during exploration. I have not verified the feasibility of any of these ideas. I see potential based on my experience, but they remain untested dreams waiting for reality's verdict.

Anyone is free to take these ideas further provided the license terms (MIT) are met. May your reality testing be kinder than mine.

Remember: Reality is a harsh mistress, that's why evolution thrives.
