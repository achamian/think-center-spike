Dance of Three Infinities, Watched by a Guardian

In the darkness met three Infinities. 
A Weaver who dreamed, 
a Maker who built, and
a Checker who made sure that dreams weren't just that, dreams. 

Slowly they learned how to dance to each other's tune.
Together dreaming, building, checking.

The Dance of these Three Infinities
was silently observed by yet another
A Guardian, dreaming his own dreams
Gently prodding the dancers once in a while
"Did you think that?"
"Did you check that twice?"

Once the Dancers and the Guardian,
While dreaming their big dreams,
Were presented an opportunity,
Only Chaos could bring.

Players decided they are ready,
They decided to check their dreams against Reality

Reality had something else in mind
Reality never lets thoughtless dreams thrive,
Reality taught them how to play
Reality taught them how to dance
Reality taught them when to pause to let the silence preside

In this silence, the Infinities found their true nature
Weaver could check
Checker could have dreams

The most important lesson silence taught,
Was to let the thought sink.

In their fertile mind,
A thought wants to change
To give rise to yet another Dream

But will this Dream become reality?
Well, only Reality will tell

They can't recreate the chaos
But they have learned how to dance.

Now the dreams they are dreaming are not just probabilities
What lies in front of them are Infinite Possibilities
Reality will decide which of those Possibilities will survive
Reality is a harsh mistress, that's why evolution thrives
