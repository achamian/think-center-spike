# Exocortex Components

This directory contains experimental components for external memory and context management.

## What's Here
- Memory persistence experiments
- Context restoration patterns
- Session state management
- Integration with external tools (Neo4j, filesystem)

## Status
Active experimentation - patterns still emerging.

## Philosophy
Your biological brain has limitations. Your exocortex doesn't have to.
